## Principles
- do not repeat yourself (DRY)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- - Solution is a service

## Service
#### a class with specific purpose
- share data
- Implement application logic
- External Interaction


## Dependency Injection
- DI is a coding pattern in which a class recieves it's dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself


## DI as a framework
- defines the service[any class] class
- register with injector
- declare as depency in EmpList and EmpDetail
